        Event Management Using Loaded DOM Content:
        When the first HTML page has loaded and been parsed entirely, without having to wait for stylesheets, graphics, or subframes to fully load, the DOMContentLoaded event is triggered.
After the DOM has fully loaded, you are executing code using document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {... }). By doing this, you can make sure that your JavaScript code doesn't run before the HTML content is prepared.
      </li>
      <li>
        Handling of Form Submission:
        Using form.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {... }), you have added an event listener to the form with the id madLibForm.
Using event.preventDefault(), you may stop the default form submission action inside this event listener. By doing this, the form can't be submitted the conventional way, and you may manage the submission using JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        DOM Trickery:
        Using document.getElementById('elementId').value, you are reading the values of different form inputs (noun, adjective, verb, adverb, pluralNoun). This gets the values that the user has typed in each input field as of right now.
The form data is being dynamically created as a URL-encoded string (formData), which will be submitted as part of a POST request to the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Error Reduction:
        Using.catch(), you're taking care of potential fetch operation faults. You record errors to the console if they arise during the retrieve procedure (such as server or network errors).
